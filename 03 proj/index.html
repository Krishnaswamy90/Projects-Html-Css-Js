    <h2 class="card-title">1. Malware</h2>
    <p>Malware — or malicious software — is any program or code that is created with the intent to do harm to a computer, network or server. Malware is the most common type of cyberattack, mostly because this term encompasses many subsets such as ransomware, trojans, spyware, viruses, worms, keyloggers, bots, cryptojacking, and any other type of malware attack that leverages software in a malicious way </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">2. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks</h2>
    <p>In a DoS attack, users are unable to perform routine and necessary tasks, such as accessing email, websites, online accounts or other resources that are operated by a compromised computer or network. While most DoS attacks do not result in lost data and are typically resolved without paying a ransom, they cost the organization time, money and other resources in order to restore critical business operations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">3. Phishing</h2>
    <p>Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses email, SMS, phone, social media, and social engineering techniques to entice a victim to share sensitive information — such as passwords or account numbers — or to download a malicious file that will install viruses on their computer or phone.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">4. Spoofing</h2>
    <p>Spoofing is a technique through which a cybercriminal disguises themselves as a known or trusted source. In so doing, the adversary is able to engage with the target and access their systems or devices with the ultimate goal of stealing information, extorting money or installing malware or other harmful software on the device.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">5. Identity-based attacks</h2>
    <p>Identity-driven attacks are extremely hard to detect. When a valid user’s credentials have been compromised and an adversary is masquerading as that user, it is often very difficult to differentiate between the user’s typical behavior and that of the hacker using traditional security measures and tools.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">6. Code injection attacks</h2>
    <p>Code injection attacks consist of an attacker injecting malicious code into a vulnerable computer or network to change its course of action. There are multiple types of code injection attacks:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">7. Supply chain attacks</h2>
    <p>A supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers services or software vital to the supply chain. Software supply chain attacks inject malicious code into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks compromise physical components for the same purpose. Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components, such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">8. Social engineering attacks</h2>
    <p>Social engineering is a technique where attackers use psychological tactics to manipulate people into taking a desired action. Through the use of powerful motivators like love, money, fear, and status, attackers can gather sensitive information that they can later use to either extort the organization or leverage such information for a competitive advantage.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">9. Insider threats</h2>
    <p>IT teams that solely focus on finding adversaries external to the organization only see half the picture. Insider threats are internal actors such as current or former employees that pose danger to an organization because they have direct access to the company network, sensitive data, and IP as well as knowledge of business processes, company policies, or other information that would help carry out such an attack.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
   <h2 class="card-title">10. DNS tunneling</h2>
    <p>DNS Tunneling is a type of cyberattack that leverages domain name system (DNS) queries and responses to bypass traditional security measures and transmit data and code within the network.</p>
